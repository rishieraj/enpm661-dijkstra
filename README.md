# ENPM661: Project-2
Implementation and Visualization of **Dijkstra's Algorithm**.

## 1. Description:
The goal of the project is to implement Dijkstra Algorithm to find the shortest path between a random pair of start and goal points for a point robot in a given map.

## 2. Contents

 - `dijkstra_rishie_raj.py` : python script containing the code for the project.

 - `dijkstra_rishie_raj.mp4` : video file containing the visualization.

 - `README.md` : markdown file containing instructions and details.

## 3. How to Use:
Please follow the following steps to implement the code in a local system:

 - Download the .py file that was provided as part of the submission or retrieve it from the following GitHub repo: https://github.com/rishieraj/enpm661-dijkstra.git .

 - Once retrieved, the .py file can be executed directly. Upon execution, the user will be prompted to enter the start and goal nodes in the Cartesian Coordinate format i.e. (X, Y).  
 **Note:** The coordinates need to be added as per the origin described in the project documentation.

 - Once the start and goal points are added, the program might take upto ~30 sec to implement depending on the distance between the two.

 - Once the goal is reached, the program prints *Goal Reached!* along with the computation time. It then goes on to perform the visualization of the node exploration and optimal path between start and goal.

## 4. Libraries/Dependencies Used:
The following libraries have been used in the program:

 - Numpy ( `numpy` ): used for array operations and mathematical calculations.

 - Queue ( `queue.PriorityQueue` ): used for handling nodes in Dijkstra Algorithm due to easy popping of lowest order element.

 - Time ( `time` ): used to calculate computation time.

 - OpenCV ( `opencv` ): used for display and visualization purposes.
